`libmiu' is a set of classes that provide high level access to the
Miu protocol specification.

This version implements version 1 of the Miu protocol specification.


It is structured as follows:

Connection Classes:

  MiuSocket  --- a low level socket wrapper providing access to the
                 transaction streams and SSL handling. Normally this
                 class is not directly used in most applications.

  MiuClient  --- a high level class providing tools to communicate with
                 Miu servers. This class is used on the client-side.
                 This is the class you want to use when creating new clients
                 and bots. Connecting to tracker is supported by using a sub-
                 set of available class functions.

  MiuServer  --- a high level class providing tools to communicate with
                 Miu clients.
