This is Qwired, a free Wired client written in C++ using the Qt4 framework.
It can be compiled on any Qt-supported platform (Mac, Windows, Linux).

Most of the work has been done by Bastian Bense <bastibense@gmail.com>.

Special thanks go out to Axel Andersson, the maker of the original Wired client.
