**Qwired Client** is a multi-platform client for the Wired protocol. It is written in C++ and using the Qt4 framework, providing a very good multi-platform experience for the user.

It allows you to connect to Wired servers and participate in chats, private messaging and file transfers from a single application. All data transmitted between users is encrypted using OpenSSL on all supported platforms. Primary development targets are Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. The project is licensed under the GPL, so more platforms may be targeted in the future.

**Qwired Server** is also under development and soon will offer a multi-platform server aimed to be stable and scalable.
