== Is Qwired Client/Server compatible with Mac OS X 10.3? ==
No. We kept compatibility as long as possible. Starting with Qt 4.6 it is not support by our development tools anymore, so we are not going to put any effort in supporting a 6 year old, deprecated operating system. If you have an old machine standing around that you'd like to use as a Qwired-server, please upgrade that machine to at least Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5.
