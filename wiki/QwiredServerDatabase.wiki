= Database Structure =

The initial database structure is created when Qwired Server launches for the first time and there is no database file. You can find the SQL schema here:

http://code.google.com/p/qwired-suite/source/browse/trunk/qw_server/resources/server_db.sql

== Tables ==
  * *qws_config* - Contains all configuration key/value pairs. See table below for more information.
  * *qws_news* - Contains all news post entries.
  * *qws_files* - Contains temporary indexing information about files that are available in the server files-root. This is used to speed up remote searching of files.
  * *qws_groups* - Contains all user account groups.
  * *qws_accounts* - Contains all user account information, might reference to entries in _qws_groups_ if a user account is part of a group.
