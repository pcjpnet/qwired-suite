#summary Qwired protocol extensions (Version 3)
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =
Qwired provides a number of additional features, and therefore requires a number of additional commands.

This specification effectively extends the [QwiredProtocolVersion11 Qwired Protocol 1.1].

= Commands =
== Command Listing ==
=== LOG ===
`"LOG" SP enable EOT`

  * enable = BOOL
 
Enable real-time transmission of log messages to the client.

On failure, may return the error 516, or begins transmission of 800 Log Message messages.

Subject to _server-console_ privilege.

= Messages =

== 800 Class Messages ==

=== 800 Log Message ===
`"800" SP timestamp FS type FS origin FS text EOT`

  * timestamp = date-time
  * type = STRING
  * origin = STRING
  * text = STRING

A server log message has been emitted by _origin_, a string that identifies the source of the information (server core, user, etc.). _text_ contains the information about the event. _type_ defines the type of the message, which can be "INFO", "WARN", "FATAL" or "DEBUG".

This message is subject to the _LOG_ command.
